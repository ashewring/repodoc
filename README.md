# Repository documentation app

Browsing repository through GitHub could work better. Especially trying to find out things when only descriptive information is first line from the commit that last changed it. This app adds documentation on top of regular Git repository to better explain what it's and its files are for.

It's just started. Will see how it goes. NOTE: this app is mainly a ClojureScript learning project.
